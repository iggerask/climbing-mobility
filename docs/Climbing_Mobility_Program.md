# Mobility Program for Bouldering (Evidence-Based)

Improving your hip, hamstring, and shoulder mobility can **enhance climbing performance** and reduce strain in extreme positions. Research shows that elite climbers have significantly greater hip flexibility and better shoulder mobility (especially external rotation) compared to non-climbers. Increased range of motion gives you more movement options on the wall – e.g. higher foot placements, deeper drop-knees, or wider reaches – without as much discomfort. While general stretching alone isn’t a guarantee against injury, expanding your usable range (and strengthening it) means those crux moves won’t push your joints to their limits, **potentially lowering injury risk in those extreme positions**. With that in mind, this program integrates mobility work **into your climbing and lifting schedule**, using minimal equipment (just bands and a box) and a weekly deep stretching session. Each module is backed by science and timed to fit your workouts for maximum benefit.
